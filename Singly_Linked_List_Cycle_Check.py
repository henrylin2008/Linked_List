# ProblemÂ¶
# Given a singly linked list, write a function which takes in the first node in a singly linked list and returns a boolean indicating if the linked list contains a "cycle".

# A cycle is when a node's next point actually points back to a previous node in the list. This is also sometimes known as a circularly linked list.

# You've been given the Linked List Node class code:

class Node(object):
    
    def __init__(self,value):
        
        self.value = value
        self.nextnode = None



# Solution
# To solve this problem we will have two markers traversing through the list. marker1 and marker2. We will have both makers begin at the first node of the 
# list and traverse through the linked list. However the second marker, marker2, will move two nodes ahead for every one node that marker1 moves.
# By this logic we can imagine that the markers are "racing" through the linked list, with marker2 moving faster. If the linked list has a cylce and is 
# circularly connected we will have the analogy of a track, in this case the marker2 will eventually be "lapping" the marker1 and they will equal each other.
# If the linked list has no cycle, then marker2 should be able to continue on until the very end, never equaling the first marker.
# Let's see this logic coded out:


def cycle_check(node):

    # Begin both markers at the first node
    marker1 = node
    marker2 = node

    # Go until end of list
    while marker2 != None and marker2.nextnode != None:
        
        # Note
        marker1 = marker1.nextnode
        marker2 = marker2.nextnode.nextnode

        # Check if the markers have matched
        if marker2 == marker1:
            return True

    # Case where marker ahead reaches the end of the list
    return False
