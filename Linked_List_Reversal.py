# ProblemÂ¶
# Write a function to reverse a Linked List in place. The function will take in the head of the list as input and return the new head of the list.

# You are given the example Linked List Node class:

class Node(object):
    
    def __init__(self,value):
        
        self.value = value
        self.nextnode = None
